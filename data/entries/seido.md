Uphold the highest ethical standards, ensuring that your actions are guided by honesty, responsibility, and respect for others.

Uphold the highest ethical standards, ensuring that your actions are guided by honesty, responsibility, and respect for others.

The Way of Integrity reminds us about ethical considerations above all the impact and metrics. More often than not, noble intentions without considering consequences and the self-sufficiency of social systems ruin more lives than they save. Integrity teaches us to build your philanthropic work upon a strong foundation of ethical principles, respecting the autonomy and self-determination of social systems, and prioritizing long-term iterative responsible solutions over on-off and careless monetary interventions.

### Mind-sets

**Ethical Integrity:**

To uphold the highest ethical standards in all interactions with beneficiaries is essential to ensure your actions cause no harm and avoid conflicts of interest.

**Small is beautiful:**

Thinking in such terms doesn't mean little impact. Small-scale, careful, and well-designed interventions have the potential to transform the largest systems. Like the butterfly effect, small reproducible change cases become infectious by their simplicity and can cause a chain reaction, achieving profound and positive worldwide change. Nurturing a beautiful mind creates things that are loved and impacts that last.

**Excellence mind:**

Legendary quality is never achieved through an act of generosity alone. Extensive financial resources can propagate good solutions as well as bad ones. An excellence mind focuses your attention on producing high-quality outcomes, abstracting financial and time expenses. Setting your mind for excellence helps us prioritise quality over quantity, make evidence-based social decisions, and support your own personal integrity.

**Impartiality:**

Maintaining an impartiality mind-set is essential in conducting ethical and responsible philanthropic affairs. An impartial mind is aware of and acknowledges biases, constantly challenging assumptions, and always seeking diverse and contradictory perspectives. Impartiality is a lifelong journey into the depths of your mind, uncovering misconceptions, subjective assessments, leaps of abstraction, and ideological manipulations, forming a solid foundation for social change.

**Balance:**

Social systems are inherently unpredictable and volatile. Human and animal suffering can cause internal turmoil and impulsive behavior. Maintaining a balanced state of mind is essential to preserve the integrity of your thoughts. It is imperative to keep your mind unbiased and unmoved by events. Only by maintaining a balanced state can we avoid reactive traps and implement structural interventions that change system behavior.

**Sandalwood state**

Just as sandalwood preserves its essence and fragrance under all conditions, a philanthropist should maintain purity and consistency of thought regardless of external circumstances. This encourages the Jizendo practitioner to cultivate a mind that remains unfazed, pure, and focused.

### Practice and Implementation

**Code of conduct**

Create a social agreement to become the foundation of all your actions. Understand and outline your highest commitment to ethical principles, transparency, and responsibility in social work, making your philanthropy more accountable and systemic.

**Independent Evaluation**

Attract independent evaluators who are entirely impartial and free from any bias towards your work. Acquire objective assessments of interventions, determining the true impact on the system you are about to implement.

**Risk Assessment**

Recognize the importance of evaluating the risks associated with interventions. Commit resources to thoroughly assess potential risks and unintended consequences. Aim to protect the integrity of the system, prevent dependency on funding, and ensure that your philanthropic endeavors align with ethical and sustainable practices.

**Exit Strategy**

Establish clear criteria for disengagement from projects that do not adhere to your ethical principles and commitment to objectivity. This ensures your freedom to disengage when necessary to uphold your standards.

**Evaluation Framework**

Establish a comprehensive evaluation framework in advance, clearly defining criteria and indicators to measure the project's success systematically and thoroughly. This approach guarantees a rigorous and well-structured evaluation process and measurements of success.

**Beneficiary-Centric Focus**

Always place the well-being and interests of beneficiaries and stakeholders at the forefront of your actions. Focus on developing solutions that genuinely benefit those affected, prioritizing their needs and concerns above your desire for power, control, or social fame.

**Seidō (正道) no Michi - The Way of Integrity** establishes a holistic approach to philanthropy, ensuring that actions are ethical, effective, and sustainable, ultimately leading to meaningful and positive social change.

This michi cautions against noble intentions that neglect the consequences and self-sufficiency of social systems, which can lead to more harm than good. This philosophical construct advocates for building philanthropic work on a strong foundation of ethical principles, respecting the autonomy and self-determination of social systems, and prioritizing long-term, iterative solutions over short-lived, careless interventions.
