# Daiku no Michi (大工) - The Way of Mastery

Commit to the lifelong journey of mastering your craft of Philanthropy, continuously improving and honing your skills with dedication.

The way of mastery is one of the most significant choices one can make in their life. It influences all facets of life, changing our attitude towards our goals, aspirations, and visions. The way of mastery is a mastery of the mind. It is the lifelong journey to the inner world, where one can find true wisdom, become self-aware, and influence the outer world. Becoming a Master is a choice that sets the direction of thoughts and approach to actions until the end of days.

This principle, being chosen as a primary way of thinking, becomes a solid foundation for all other Jizendo principles and reinforces self-development.

### Mind States

**Heightened Awareness**:  
Develop a keen awareness of the tools and techniques at your disposal. Understand the materials (or situations) you are working with and how to manipulate them effectively. By being aware of your thoughts, you take control over your actions and your destiny.

**Root Cause State**:  
Identify the fundamental aspects of your craft or discipline. Understand the basic principles that underlie advanced techniques.

**Process Over Result**:  
Focus on perfecting the process only. Results are mere consequences of a series of actions, being reflections of mastery, serving as feedback for mastery. By removing expectations, the mind is freed from tensions and can operate effectively, mastering the craft in the present moment.

**Water State**:  
A Master learns from water two fundamental traits: effectively taking a hit and persistence. A liquid mind accepts failures and successes lightly, perceiving them as feedback and a gift for continuously improving processes.

By mastering the inner thought process and directing thoughts toward desired outcomes, we influence the outer world through right words and actions. By being aware of our thoughts, we are able to transform negative outcomes into positive ones.

### Practice and Implementation:

**Learning from Mistakes**:

Embrace failures as opportunities to learn and improve. Each mistake provides valuable feedback for future attempts.

**Iterative Improvement**:

Continuously iterate and improve upon your techniques. Strive for precision and excellence in every aspect of your work.

**Meticulous Attention to Detail:**

Precision, practiced as a skill and becoming a habit, brings a sense of control over multiple variables. It iteratively reduces complexity and develops a deep understanding of the craft. Uncertainties, earlier perceived as anxieties, become no more than a web of processes emerging automatically by the mind, hard-wired by precision.

**Intentional Practice**:

Intentional practice is the thread that connects learning with mastery. It is a practice with heightened awareness of the process and a clear understanding of the end result.

- Wake up before any mundane action.
- Set the awareness in the center.
- Mentally visualize the process, whether it's building a structure or executing a technique. See each step clearly in your mind.
- Carefully measure and adjust your actions based on previous outcomes.
- Conduct the operation with precision and an intention of improvement.
- Learn from each attempt and refine your approach.
