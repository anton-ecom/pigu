# Kūshin no Michi (空心) - The Way of Free Mind

## Kūshin (空心) - The Free Mind represents a state of mental clarity and freedom from attachments, allowing for natural and effective action.

True Mastery and freedom come from a mind unburdened by the outcomes and worries of the future and the past. By releasing attachments to results and anxieties,, you achieve a state of mental clarity and presence. Opening your mind to what allows for spontaneous and effective action. This state is characterized by a focus on the present moment, where actions are guided by intuition and natural flow rather than overthinking and fear.

### Mind States:

**Presence**:

Practice mindfulness to remain fully present in each moment. Let go of thoughts about the past and future, focusing instead on the here and now.

**Non-Attachment to Results**:

Train with the mindset that the process is more important than the outcome. Focus on the quality of thoughts and actions rather than the end result.

**Emotional Release**:

Practice techniques for releasing emotional attachments and anxieties. Recognize and let go of emotions tied to past failures or future fears.

**Wu Wei (Effortless Action)**:

Embrace the Taoist principle of Wu Wei, allowing actions to arise naturally and effortlessly. Trust in the flow of life and the guidance of intuition.

**Harmony with the Present**:

Seek harmony with the present moment, understanding that true peace and effectiveness come from being fully engaged with the now.

### Practice:

**Release attachments and expectations:**

Develop practices for recognising and releasing emotional attachments to pre-determined outcomes. Free your mind by journaling progress and practicing daily review of your mind for any attachments to outcomes or dreams of a particular future.

**Remove wants and dreams:**

Mindset of a master of Philanthropy is free from personal wants and dreams of a better future. Focus on what you can do today, what is within your control and accept uncertainty of the future.

**Use "River principle":**

Do not fight the force of the current, accept the flow and control your movement to avoid obstacles.

**Use "Even better principle":**

Whatever happens as perceived negative or positive outcome, accept it's for the better. Seek positive in negative to balance forces. Let go of fear of failure or expectations of success, accept that both and celebrate equally.

**Embrace uncertainty:**

Philanthropy is uncertain. By cultivating a state of mental clarity and presence, Master of Philanthropy learns to accept the complexity and take control over the present moment.
