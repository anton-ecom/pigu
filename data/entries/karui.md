# Karui Michi (軽い道) - The Way of Leverage

Commit to the lifelong journey of mastering your craft of Philanthropy, continuously improving and honing your skills with dedication.

This principle suggests using minimal effort to achieve maximum impact. Instead of applying brute force, leverage the dynamics and existing forces within a system to create change. Amateur mind jumps to quick solutions, creating tension and greater disorder. Master of the Way of Leverage listens to the system, creating intelligence. By learning the system's history, roles, rules of the game, Master applies forces of the system itself to change its course. True leverage rarely requires force or significant resources. The force is hidden in systems own dynamics of change, all that is required is to use it.

### Mental States

**Observant Mind**:

Train observing without immediately acting. This allows you to see the natural flow and leverage points within the system.

**Heightened Awareness**:

Develop a keen sense of awareness to understand the dynamics of any situation. Recognize the forces at play and how they interact.

**Root-Cause State:**

Habitually identify the root causes of problems. These are often the hardest to accept but may be the easiest to influence once understood. Focus on the underlying issues rather than superficial symptoms.

\*\*HIMI Mode of Thinking:

Ask yourself, "What is the most effective and the easiest thing to do?" Focus on small actions that have significant impacts. Identify actions that require minimal effort but produce maximum results.

**Problem-Solution State**

Habitually frame each situation by clearly identifying the problem and potential solutions. Iterate until you achieve clarity. Each time new information arrives, reframe the problem and its solution.

**Let Go**

If you cannot see an effective method, sometimes the best solution is to observe the system until leverage points emerge naturally.Allow the system to reveal its dynamics over time without forcing change. Allow the systems to change to the state, where it can be influenced most effectively.

**Mango Principle Thinking**

If the problem is too complex, identify and solve one minor issue. This can lead to discovering other leverage points or insights. Achieve progress through small, manageable steps. Create a habit of identifying least resistant and fruitful action. Most efficient action is achieved by removing distracting actions.

### Practical Steps and Instructions

**Hysteresis**

Understand the history of the system to identify patterns and leverage points. History often provides clues to effective interventions. Use historical context to inform your approach and avoid past mistakes.

**One Thing**

Ask yourself, "What is one thing I can do, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary?" Focus on this key action to create significant impact. Prioritize actions that simplify and streamline your efforts.

**Dance with the System**

Instead of grappling with systems forces, observe where the system is naturally heading and collaborate with that change. Adapt fluidly to the system’s dynamics, aligning your actions with its natural flow.

**Attentive Listening**

Practice deep, attentive listening to understand the system and its stakeholders. Often, the most influential solutions will reveal themselves through careful and continuous observation.

**What's working**

Instead of focusing on problems, focus on what's working and act to empower it. Leverage existing forces and capabilities, redirecting change, rather than enforcing own version of change.

**Use the Force**

Do not apply force; instead, identify and use the existing forces within the system to address the problem. Redirect and harness these forces to your advantage. Adapt to the situation by using its momentum rather than resisting it. Collaborate with systems dynamics and apply minimal force to create maximum impact.
