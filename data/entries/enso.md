# Enso no Michi (縁) - The Way of Synergy

Foster synergy by integrating diverse elements into a cohesive whole, creating greater impact through collaborative effort.

---

Synergy means behaviour of whole system unpredicted by the behaviour of their parts taken separately. The Way of Synergy emphasises the interconnectedness and collective potential of systems. This principle is inherent into all facets of our life and manifest itself on all levels of reality. The way of Synergy is the way to leverage this universal principle to create greater impact from seemingly minor parts. It is a habit of seeking hidden relationships and connecting elements of the system in the way that creates a self-reinforcing system. Synergy is alike an alchemic potion, that philanthropist can use to turn lead into gold, bringing thei highest visions to life.

### Mind-sets:

#### Perspectivism

Proactively collecting different perspectives, enriching your understanding of the world and the challenge at hand.

Perspectivism mind-set teaches us to engage in active listening; Consiously collecting and valuing different vantage points. By being unbiased and nonjudgmental, we unlock the collective wisdom required to surmount the greatest challenges we aspire to conquer. In the tapestry of varied perspectives, we find the threads of unity, empathy, and the shared vision needed to create a better world.

#### Order

Order mindset seeks for restoring order and balance in the system above all else.

Every social and economic system strives for order and balance. In this balancing act, systems maintain integrity and resilient. If a system is in disorder, parts of the system struggling and breaking down. Order mind-set invites us to help the system to restore order. We intentionally seek the source of order, by inspecting systems dynamics and looking for dysfunctional relationships. By restoring order, we help system to restore its operations and return to balance at minimal energy expense.

#### Mutualism

Mutualistic mind actively looks for mutually beneficial actions and leverage shared capabilities

Mutualism is a type of ecological interaction where both participants benefit from the relationship. Ecological studies suggest that up to 90% of species are involved in mutualistic relationships. Mutualist mind embrace and search for cooperation over competition. Switching to and operating in this mode is to seek closer partnerships, reciprocity, and shared capabilities to achieve success. In this mindset , we habitually prioritising unions and the ways we can add value and empower different elements of the system. In this way we activate reciprocity that reinforces mutually beneficial growth and the successful development of the system we seek to improve.

#### Synthesis

In this state, you are involved in connecting and combining different elements of the system, constantly observing reactions and building upon the effects. It instructs us to intentionally engineer relationships of actors in a search for hidden leverages and runway effects.

### Practice and Implementation

**System Mapping and Analysis**:

- **Identify Connections**: Map out the elements of the system you are working with and identify potential connections. Look for how different parts can complement and enhance each other.
- **Leverage Points**: Identify points within the system where small changes can lead to significant improvements. Focus efforts on these leverage points to maximize impact.

**Collaborative Projects**:

- **Form Alliances**: Prioritise partnerships with other individuals, organizations, or entities that share your goals. Collaborative efforts can amplify the impact of your work.
- **Resource Sharing**: Pool resources with partners to achieve common objectives. This can include sharing knowledge, tools, or networks.

**Iterative Improvement**:

- **Feedback Loops**: Create systems that incorporate feedback loops to continually assess and improve upon efforts. This helps in adjusting strategies based on real-time data and outcomes.
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Be willing to adapt strategies based on the evolving dynamics of the system. Flexibility allows for better alignment with synergistic opportunities.
- AAR - Conducting after-action reviews after each iteration, observing differences and created effects, negative or positive, allows seeing and carefully directing the system towards synergy.

**Community Building**:

**Engage Stakeholders**: Involve stakeholders in the planning and implementation processes. Their insights and buy-in can create a more cohesive and effective effort.

**Foster Mutual Support**: Encourage mutual support among community members. Building a network of support can create a self-reinforcing system of aid and collaboration.

**Organizational Synergy:** Encourage organisational practices that promote synergy between different departments and teams. Recognize and reward collaborative efforts that lead to innovative outcomes.

**Learning organisation:** Powerful governance structures such as Holocracy and Sociocracy 2.0 open new ways for your team to proactively adopt to the challenges and hear previously hidden voices of truth.
